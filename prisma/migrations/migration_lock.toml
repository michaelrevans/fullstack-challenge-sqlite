# Postgres or MySQL would be better choices for production due to the better durability with larger volumes of data
# they also provide better handling of large write volumes, which could overwhelm sqlite
# Document-based NoSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB, DynamoDB) could also be considered due to their faster access. The only
# downside is their inability to join large numbers of records across tables quickly, giving relational
# DBs an edge for this use case.
